**Overview**:
- As UCSD students, we are frequently driving around San Diego, and have thus witnessed our fair share of accidents in the city. With recent weather patterns growing increasingly unpredictable, we are eager to investigate whether there exists a correlation between weather and the frequency of accidents. A staggering 31,785 individuals lost their lives in traffic crashes in 2022. Shockingly, roughly one in every ten of these fatalities occurred in California. Our study aims to explore this potential relationship between weather conditions, seasons, and the daily frequency of accidents in San Diego. By carefully analyzing traffic data, we hope to uncover whether weather and seasonal changes hold a significant impact on the frequency of accidents in our area. Ultimately, our goal is to provide insights that may aid in improving road safety and reducing the number of accidents in “America’s Finest City”. [^1]
